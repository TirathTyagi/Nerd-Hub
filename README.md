This is also one of the applications that I created during my Android App Development Course.
This application consists of various books that are fetched through the web and their description. I have plans on working on it in the future and putting it on play store once I think the app is developed enough for that level.

Presently this application only consists of few books with their descriptions. You can add those books to the favourites and check the prices, author etc for that book.
